## Format reference

- `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter are required
- Description should be under 1024 characters
- Body should be under 500 lines
- Use `references/` subdirectory for supporting docs
- Use `scripts/` subdirectory for executable helpers
- Write instructions for "an AI coding agent" (not a specific agent) for cross-agent compatibility
